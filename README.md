# FastAPI + Celery Background Email Sender

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Celery with FastAPI for handling background tasks, specifically for sending emails. Celery is a robust distributed task queue that is more powerful and reliable than FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks, especially for long-running or resource-intensive operations. By using Celery, tasks are processed outside the main FastAPI process, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.

The email sending functionality is implemented as a Celery background task, which helps avoid issues with spam detection and ensures reliable deliveryâ€”similar to Django's email system. The project is configured to use Gmail's SMTP server with industry best practices (port 587 and STARTTLS), and all email settings are managed in a dedicated configuration file for clarity and security.

This setup is ideal for production-grade applications that require robust background processing and reliable email delivery.

## How to run
1. Run the service using docker:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

Now, if you go to `http://localhost:8000/` you will see a message that the task is running in the background. You can also see the celery worker logs in the console.
